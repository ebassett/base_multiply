Here's a good start:
- quotient (ie. carry) and remainder (ie. number(?!)) from divmod
- input to divmod:
  - index of digit times index of digit
    - where what we are indexing into is the substring of 0-F that is appropriate for the base
  - the base

Now we just need to - hm, well, on second thought this is going to more complicated than I initially thought.
I was going to think about whether I should do right-to-left processing by just reversing the input string of digits,
 or by doing something fancier with a negative step.
But that's possibly premature.
Well, no, I guess I do have to address it now.
But let's start with a simple case, with only one number a more than one (ie. 2) digits.
And by just reversing the stings, for simplicity's sake. I may revisit that later.

Okay, so far so good; I've got it working when one number is multi-digit.

Next: handle both numbers being multi-digit.
